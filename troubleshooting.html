<h1><center><font size='12'>What is Trouble Shooting</center></h1></font>
<p><font size='5'> troubleshoot is solving a problem or determining a problem to an issue. <br>Troubleshooting often involves the process of elimination, where a technician follows a set of steps to determine the problem or resolve the problem.</p></font> 
<p><font size='5'>There are many different things that could cause a problem with your computer. 
No matter what's causing the issue,troubleshooting will always be a process of trial and error—in some cases, you may need to use several different approaches before you can find a solution; other problems may be easy to fix. We recommend starting by using the following tips.</p></font>

<p><cite>1)Write down your steps: Once you start troubleshooting, you may want to write down each step you take.<br/> 
This way, you'll be able to remember exactly what you've done and can avoid repeating the same mistakes.<br/> 
If you end up asking other people for help, it will be much easier if they know exactly what you've tried already.</cite></p>

<p style="font-size:12;"><cite>2)Take notes about error messages: If your computer gives you an error message, be sure to write down as much information as possible.<br/> 
You may be able to use this information later to find out if other people are having the same error.</cite><p>
<hr>
<p><cite>3)Restart the computer: When all else fails, restarting the computer is a good thing to try.<br/> 
This can solve a lot of basic issues you may experience with your computer.</cite></p>

<h1 style=color:red;><center><font size='12'>What Are The Aspects??</center></h1></font>
<p><font size='5'>Usually troubleshooting is applied to something that has suddenly stopped working, since its previously working state forms the expectations about its continued behavior. <br>
So the initial focus is often on recent changes to the system or to the environment in which it exists. (For example, a printer that "was working when it was plugged in over there"). However, there is a well known principle that correlation does not imply causality. (For example, the failure of a device shortly after it has been plugged into a different outlet doesn't necessarily mean that the events were related. 
The failure could have been a matter of coincidence.) Therefore, troubleshooting demands critical thinking rather than magical thinking.</font></p>

<p>
<font size='5'>
><b>Reboot your computer.</b>- It may seem like a simple suggestion, but rebooting your computer will fix many of the problems you may be having. Press the Power button or use the Shut Down command to safely turn the computer off. If the computer is not responding, press and hold the Power button for about five seconds to force the computer to power off.
Allow your computer to sit for about thirty seconds after being turned off before you turn it back on again.
If your computer isn’t restarting, you may not be getting any power.<br/><br>
><b>Try to determine what caused the problem you are having.</b>- Think back to when the computer started having issues. Was a certain program installed, or a change made to the hardware? Was something suspicious downloaded, or installed with a program you got? Was there a power outage and now things aren't working correctly? Narrowing down the possible cause of the problem will make it much easier to determine how to proceed.
<br><br>
><b>Perform a Google search for the problem you're experiencing.</b>- There are countless issues your computer could be experiencing. Problems can occur with your programs, operating system, hardware, or network setup. While it would be impossible to cover every problem in this article, there's a very good chance that someone else has had the same problem that you're facing. Searching Google for possible solutions is often the fastest way to get your computer working again.
